# Caracterização dos movimentos pendulares nas principais vias de acesso à cidade de Lisboa



## Abstract
This report presents a study aimed at analyzing the daily traffic flows during peak hours in 
Lisbon, considering factors such as the school calendar, vacation periods, and the 
occurrence of rainy periods at the city's main entry and exit points. Using mobile data, we 
investigated how people move during the morning (7:00 am - 10:00 am) and afternoon 
(5:00 pm - 8:00 pm) peak hours, as well as other periods with high traffic, such as Fridays 
and Sundays. Additionally, we applied predictive models to anticipate future mobility 
scenarios. These models were based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically the 
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). We demonstrated that these models could predict mobile 
traffic intensity with some accuracy, achieving error rates below 10%. Thus, enabling the 
anticipation of future mobility scenarios and the identification of critical congestion points 
on the main city access routes at different times of the week.
